# Cyclistic Bike-Share Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a **data analysis case study** on the **Cyclistic** bike-share program, focusing on **customer usage patterns** and providing recommendations to convert **casual riders to member riders**. The analysis uses **SQL** for data cleaning, aggregation, and exploration, and **R** for analysis, visualization, and generating insights.

The case study demonstrates the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to derive actionable business recommendations.

## Installation Instructions
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   
2. Install necessary R packages (if you don't have them already):
   install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "RMarkdown", "tidyverse"))
   
3. Download the required data (if necessary) and place it in the corresponding folder within the repository.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Open the repository folder in RStudio.

2. Open the RMarkdown file (case_study.Rmd).

3. Knit the RMarkdown file to generate the HTML output of the case study.

- Click the Knit button in RStudio or run the following command in R:
  rmarkdown::render("case_study.Rmd")
  
4. This will generate the case_study_output.html file, which includes the analysis results and visualizations.
