# **Cyclistic Case Study**

## **Overview**  
This repository contains a data analysis case study focused on customer usage patterns and strategies to convert casual riders into members. The analysis utilizes **SQL** for data cleaning, aggregation, and exploration, and **R** for analysis, visualization, and generating insights.  

This is the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate, showcasing skills in SQL, R, data visualization, and business problem-solving.

It demonstrates the end-to-end process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to derive actionable business recommendations.

## **Description**  
This analysis explores customer usage trends to identify strategies for increasing member subscriptions.  

- **Cyclistic** is a fictional company based on real-world data from **Divvy**, a Chicago-based bike-share company.  

- The Director of Marketing believes that increasing annual memberships is crucial for the company's long-term success. Since annual members generate higher revenue than casual riders, this study aims to uncover key insights and provide three actionable recommendations to encourage casual riders to become members.  

- The dataset includes 12 months of ride history (Nov 2023 – Oct 2024), comprising millions of ride records. The data is publicly available under a data-sharing agreement: [Divvy Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

- **Note:** This dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII).
