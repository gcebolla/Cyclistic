## **Description**  
This analysis explores customer usage trends to identify strategies for increasing **member subscriptions**.  

üö¥ **Cyclistic** is a fictional company based on real-world data from **Divvy**, a Chicago-based bike-share program.  

üìå The **Director of Marketing** believes that increasing annual memberships is crucial for the company's long-term success. Since **annual members generate higher revenue than casual riders**, this study aims to uncover key insights and provide **three actionable recommendations** to encourage casual riders to become members.  

üìä The dataset includes **12 months of ride history** (Nov 2023 ‚Äì Oct 2024), comprising millions of ride records. The data, provided by **Motivate International Inc.**, is publicly available under a data-sharing agreement: [Divvy Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII).
